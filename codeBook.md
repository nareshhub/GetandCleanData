## TRANSFORMATION WORK

*For this project the dataset was downloaded from the https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip link and represents the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data.

*"README.txt" describes the useful information about the files that are needed for this project.

*To form a each observation the data needed is feature vector(features.txt) and its data(X_train.txt/X_test.txt), activity label(activity_labels.txt) and its data (y_train.txt/y_test.txt) and an identifier (subject_train.txt/subject_test.txt) who carried out the experiment.

*Extract only the measurements on the mean and std from the features.txt and use those specific columns to select the data from the test and train datasets. For better readability remove special characters from the feature vector.

*Finally merge the test and train datasets to get the clean data.
